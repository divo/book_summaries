# Chapter 15: Postmortem Culture: Learning from Failure

## Summary

This chapter, written by John Lunney and Sue Lueder, explains how organizations can systematically learn from incidents through formalized postmortem processes. The core philosophy is that "the cost of failure is education" - incidents are inevitable in large-scale systems, and without structured learning mechanisms, they will recur repeatedly. Google's approach emphasizes blameless postmortems that focus on fixing systems and processes rather than assigning blame to individuals.

## Key Concepts

- **Postmortem**: A written record documenting an incident's impact, mitigation actions, root causes, and preventive measures
- **Blameless Culture**: Assumes participants had good intentions and did the right thing with the information they had at the time
- **Psychological Safety**: Creating an environment where teams can openly discuss incidents without fear of punishment
- **Systemic Thinking**: Understanding that you can't "fix" people, but you can fix systems and processes
- **Continuous Learning**: Treating incidents as opportunities for organizational improvement

## Section Summaries

### Google's Postmortem Philosophy

The primary goals are to ensure incident documentation, thoroughly understand contributing root causes, and implement effective preventive actions. Teams establish objective criteria for when postmortems are triggered before incidents occur.

### Blameless Culture

The blameless approach originated in healthcare and aviation industries where mistakes risk lives. Rather than identifying who erred, blameless postmortems investigate why individuals possessed incomplete information, recognizing that preventing blame creates psychological safety.

### Constructive Language and Avoiding Stigma

Effective postmortems frame improvements positively rather than using accusatory language. Without psychological safety, teams suppress incidents, which increases organizational risk.

### Collaboration Framework

Postmortems leverage real-time document collaboration with rapid data collection through shared editing, open commenting systems enabling crowdsourced solutions, and email notifications for stakeholder involvement. Senior engineers review drafts for completeness and appropriate action planning.

### Review Process

An unreviewed postmortem might as well never have existed. Review sessions are essential for closing discussions, finalizing action items, ensuring complete incident data preservation, and confirming stakeholder communication.

### Building Postmortem Culture

Organizations cultivate this culture through educational activities including monthly postmortem newsletters, internal discussion groups, reading clubs discussing historical incidents, and "Wheel of Misfortune" exercises.

## Practices

- Establish objective postmortem triggers before incidents occur
- Use real-time collaborative documents for rapid data collection
- Conduct formal reviews by senior engineers to ensure completeness
- Create monthly newsletters featuring exemplary postmortem documents
- Run "Wheel of Misfortune" exercises for new team members
- Host reading clubs to discuss historical incidents
- Publicly recognize and reward effective postmortem writing
- Secure senior leadership participation and endorsement
- Survey staff regularly on cultural effectiveness and process improvements

## Key Takeaways

1. **Incidents are inevitable; learning from them is optional**: Organizations that don't formalize postmortem processes will see the same incidents recur repeatedly.

2. **Blameless does not mean accountability-free**: The focus shifts from "who caused this" to "why did our systems allow this to happen."

3. **Postmortems require active cultivation**: Building a postmortem culture requires ongoing investment through training, recognition, and leadership support.

4. **Review is essential**: An unreviewed postmortem provides little organizational value; formal review sessions close discussions and finalize action items.

5. **Psychological safety enables honest reporting**: When teams fear punishment, they suppress incidents, which increases organizational risk.
